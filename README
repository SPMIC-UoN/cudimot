Building CUDIMOT
----------------

The default makefile is designed for FSL 6.0.6+

An alternative makefile for earlier versions (tested on FSL 6.0.5) is Makefile.605

To use this makefile you will need to copy it to the name Makefile - it will not work otherwise!

Then do:

modelname=NODDI_Bingham make 

(substituting whichever model you want to build)
