Building CUDIMOT
----------------

The default makefile is designed for FSL 6.0.x

To compile, set up an FSL development environment first:

export FSLDEVDIR=<path to dev dir>
source $FSLDIR/etc/fslconf/fsl-devel.sh

Then build and install the model of your choice, e.g.

modelname=NODDI_Bingham make 
modelname=NODDI_Bingham make install

Note that Cuda compiler/libraries will need to be available. The code is
*not* compatible with Cuda versions greater than 11.1 as there is an
incompatibility with FSL libraries. This will be fixed in upcoming FSL
versions.

An alternative makefile for the upcoming Conda-based FSL 6.0.6 is Makefile.606

To use this makefile you will need to copy it to the name Makefile - it will not work otherwise!
